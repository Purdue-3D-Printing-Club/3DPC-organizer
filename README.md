Developed for the Purdue 3D Printing Club

## Dev setup

[Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/launch/) is recommended for developing Blazor WASM Apps. It is possible to develop using VScode with dotnet command line interface but if you're on windows VS makes the dependencies easier

[Docker Community](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) Not strictly necessary for development, but the app will be deployed in a docker container.

[.NET SDK 7.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0) it's a dotnet 7 application
